# KitGUI
This is a KitGUI (chest interface) plugin for Pocketmine-MP
## Important
Before installing this plugin on your server, please keep this in mind.

`- This plugin is incomplete. The only functional kit working right now is the first one.`

`- The reasons I uploaded this was for someone smarter (then 13 year-old me) to help me fix this and make this into something functional.`
## Setting Up The Plugin
There is no config.yml right now as I don't know how to do that. This is why contribtuions are highly wanted (and highly appreciated as well).
To customize the plugin for your own use, you must have it in folder form. You will need DevTools for this.
You may download DevTools from [here.](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/DevTools)

## Additonal Dependencies
None needed right now.
