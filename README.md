# KitGUI
This is a KitGUI (chest interface) plugin for Pocketmine-MP
## Important
Before installing this plugin on your server, please keep this in mind.

`- The reasons I uploaded this was for someone smarter (then 13 year-old me) to help me fix this and make this into a good workable plugin.`

## Setting Up The Plugin
There is no config.yml right now as I don't know how to do that. This is why contribtuions are highly wanted (and highly appreciated as well).
To customize the plugin for your own use, you must have it in folder form. You will need DevTools for this.
You may download DevTools from [here.](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/DevTools)

Currently, there are some Default Kits that come with the plugin, you may download the .phar version of this plugin if you are OK with using the default kits.

###Kits List (currently)
`-PvP`

`-Archer`

`-Ninja`

`-PvP+`
## Additonal Dependencies
None needed right now.
